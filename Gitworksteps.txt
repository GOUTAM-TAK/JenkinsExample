Git work steps: (normal working)
1. create a normal folder (e.g. mkdir AnyFolderName) 
2. create a repository on github
	2.1 add readme (if you want) opt
	2.2 .gitignore (files which you want to ignore while pushing) opt
	2.3 .git (history of push in git - logs) auto
3. go to directory (e.g. cd sample_folder)
4. inside the directory do : git init
5. now we have local repository but who don't know which repository from our github account
6. To add a SPECIFIC REPOSITORY do
7. git remote add origin <gitLink>
8. Now we want to push some code to the repository
9. To push any code we need some code so do : vi <yourfilename.*>
10. To push any code we need to go through different areas 

local folder ---git add file----> staging/index area ---git commit -m "write a comment"----> local repository ---git push--> finally in the github repository

11. git add file (or if you want to add all the files in the repo do) git add .
12. git commit -m "comment anything"
13. git push 
14. credentials will be asked -> username and password (username will be same as you have set on your account and password will be 'token')
 
Prerequisites: 

git config --global user.name <username>
git config --global user.email <email>


How to get a token?
1. Go to settings
2. In that go to Developer settings
3. set token and duration or expiration
4. copy the token to a file and save it
5. use the token instead for password

Extra points: 
1. git status: will give status of project- which state you are in

When git conflict between main and master

git pull <link>
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push --set-upstream origin main
